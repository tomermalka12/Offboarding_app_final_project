General Idea:
build an Gui app tool that will automate the workflow of an employee offboarding.

what have to be:
1. Gui that will show the admin whos terminating the employee a window of "Next , Next ..." - via python flask
2. Docker that will contain all the app so it can run anywhere, on any pc
3. CI/CD that will ensure all the processes
4. git for version managemt 
5. git-hub to push and pull the changes
6. kubernetes to make sure the app is always availbe 

Tech Stack
# Python Flask → Web framework providing a polished multi-step GUI for admins to trigger offboarding by username.

# Bash Script → Executes employee offboarding tasks (data deletion, access revocation, cleanup).

# Gunicorn → Production-grade WSGI server to run Flask efficiently, handling multiple concurrent requests.

# Nginx / Traefik → Reverse proxy to forward external HTTP/HTTPS requests to Gunicorn, optionally handling TLS, caching, and static files.

# Docker → Containerizes the Flask + Gunicorn app for portability and consistency.

# k3s (Lightweight Kubernetes) → Runs the containerized app, ensuring high availability, scalability, and easy orchestration.

# Helm → Packages and manages Kubernetes manifests, enabling smooth deployment, upgrades, and rollback.

# Git + GitHub → Version control and collaboration for source code.

# GitHub Actions (CI/CD) → Automates testing, Docker image build, push, and deployment to k3s.

# Prometheus & Grafana → Observability stack: Prometheus scrapes metrics from the app and cluster, Grafana visualizes dashboards for admins.

# Bootstrap + Custom CSS/JS → Modern, responsive UI with form validation, wizard steps, and confirmation popups.

Workflow

# Admin Accesses Web App
Admin opens the browser and navigates to the offboarding web app (via Nginx / Traefik ingress).

# Multi-step GUI Wizard
Admin enters the employee username.
Wizard guides through steps: Next → Confirm → Execute.
JS confirmation ensures accidental offboarding is prevented.

# Script Execution
Flask app passes the username to the Bash offboarding script.
Script handles deletion of user data, access revocation, and other cleanup tasks.

# Audit Logging
Actions are logged (username, timestamp, outcome) for tracking and compliance.

# Containerized Deployment
Flask + Gunicorn app runs in a Docker container, ensuring portability.

# Kubernetes Orchestration (k3s)
Helm chart deploys the container into k3s cluster.
Deployment ensures availability and scaling.
Ingress routes external requests to the app.

# CI/CD Automation
GitHub Actions automatically:
Tests the code
Builds Docker image
Pushes image to registry
Deploys Helm release to k3s on code changes

# Monitoring & Observability
Prometheus scrapes metrics (app uptime, request counts, errors).
Grafana dashboards visualize metrics for admins.
